* Rime: Nix CLI Wrapper Generators
Sometimes I felt the need to add pre/post hooks to Nix CLI commands; particularly for the flakes.
For example "update all sub-flakes when ~nix flake update~ is called on a parent".

The goal of this repo is collect a few wrapper generators and useful routines for extending the base TUI.

** "Rime"
Thin crystal layer of ice and snow formed by fog; particularly on branches.

** libs and types
Given that the Nix flakes interfaces revolve around URI parsing, I've defined some URI parsers and types ( using [[https://code.tvl.fyi/plain/nix/yants/default.nix][YANTS]] ).

I initially took a shot at exposing Nix's builtin =parseFlakeRef= or =fetchTree= routines, but they were rooted in the actual fetching of flakes and trees to port as standalone routines.
It could be done, but it's less effort for me to just write that stuff in Nix anyway and avoid fooling with plugins.
